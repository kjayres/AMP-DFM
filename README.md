This repository contains the code, data and implementation details for my MSc thesis at Imperial College London. The model is a discrete flow matching model with reweighted jump rates using trained classifiers on antimicrobial peptide property data. The code and implementation details are inspired by this paper by Tong et al.

The data processing and protein structure prediction were processed in separate repositories. This codebase is a refactored version of the original so some details may differ than those shared in the report.
